  Lab 2, part3: a full application

  We're going to use the skills we've just been practicing to write a full application
  which is responsive to user input.
  At your disposal are a set of variables which we use to track user input (see
  part3-main.js and part3-setup.js for more details on how this is done — we'll
  cover this topic at a later date). Their values will be logged to console to
  aid in debugging.

  In this lab, which is very much open-ended, your task is to use the value of
  these variables to define the functions below. Try to come up with interesting
  uses of the provided user input.

  Some ideas:
    There are two numeric fields: can you write this application to filter
    using both minimum and maximum?
    There is a boolean (true/false) field: can you write your code to filter according
    to this boolean? (Try to think about how you could chop up this data to make this meaningful.)
    There is a string field: can you write your code to filter/search based on user
    input?

  Remember, this is open-ended. Open ended doesn't mean pointless: we're looking for
  filters that might actually be useful. Try to see what you can produce.

/* =====================
  Define a resetMap function to remove markers from the map and clear the array of markers
===================== */
var resetMap = function() {
  _.each(myMarkers, (marker) => { //calls global `myMarkers` array and removes each one by one
    map.removeLayer(marker);});
  myMarkers = []; //resets array to empty
};

/* =====================
  Define a getAndParseData function to grab our dataset through a jQuery.ajax call ($.ajax). It
  will be called as soon as the application starts. Be sure to parse your data once you've pulled
  it down!
===================== */
var getAndParseData = function() {
  var rawData = $.ajax("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CPLN692-MUSA611/datasets/master/json/philadelphia-crime-snippet.json").done((dat) => {
    myData = JSON.parse(dat);  //calls dta from url and parses the json file - writes out to the global variable
  });
};

/* =====================
  Call our plotData function. It should plot all the markers that meet our criteria (whatever that
  criteria happens to be — that's entirely up to you)
===================== */

//userfilter to select police region between min and max
var userFilter = function(fData) {
  return fData.District >= numericField1 & fData.District <= numericField2;
};

//takes in data list and writes returns array of markers
var makeMarkers = function(pData) {
  var tempMarkers = [];
  _.each(pData, (dataLine) => {tempMarkers.push(L.marker([dataLine.Lat, dataLine.Lng]))});
  return tempMarkers;
};


//takes in a list of markers and adds each to the map one at a time
var plotMarkers = function(marker) {
  _.each(marker, (mark) => {
    mark.addTo(map);
  });
};

var plotData = function() {
  var filteredData = _.filter(myData, userFilter); //applies filter`
  myMarkers = makeMarkers(filteredData);    //generates markers and assigns to global list
  plotMarkers(myMarkers);                   //plots to map

  /* =====================
    Fill out this function definition
